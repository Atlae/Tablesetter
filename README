Hi. I'm Atlae, aka S1 TEP Collector or S2 TEP Collector or S3 TEP Collector if it ever comes out.

This tepscript repository is copied in part from 9003's gotIssues repository and Svenskskit's concepts.

To run, download and run query.py to overwrite query_links.txt. Use test.sh to remove the first two extraneous lines which would otherwise cause trouble.

Then, run list_maker.py to generate a list in tep.html. Then you should be able to go through that by clicking enter and such.

If you too want to do this but not with TEP (idk why) you would change the query URL ini query.py to fit whatever cards you want to see.

I'll add in a license later. Maybe.
